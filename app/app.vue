              At BitcyClub, success moves in rotations — just like in real markets. For one to win, another must lose.
              The
              difference here is, you're learning from every move. You're not gambling. You're building real-world
              experience — driven by data, competition, and a mindset for long-term growth.
              <br><br>
              This platform is for those who want to go beyond hype.
              It's for those who want to sharpen their thinking, build skills, and prepare for the real investment world
              with clarity.
              <br><br>
              It's gamified, but it's not a game.
              It's competitive, but not chaotic.
              It's a solution to a broken system — built to help users evolve.
              <br><br>
              BitcyClub is where your crypto journey truly begins.

          Terms or any aspect of the relationship between us (including any communications between us), whether
          based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be resolved

          the arbitrator will determine the location. The arbitrator’s decision will follow the provisions set
          forth in these Terms and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
          temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance under
          these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before
          the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. You may opt-out of this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at

          BitcyClub is where education meets competition — and where every second counts.
        </div>
        We built BitcyClub because we were tired of fake trading apps, bots, and empty promises. Our team wanted
        something real. Something fun. A fast-paced game where anyone can test their instincts, compete with others,
        and actually learn how the market moves.
        <br>
        There’s no gambling here. No fake users. No simulations. Just real people playing real-time rounds — every
        20 seconds — based on live market data.
        <br>
        Whether you’re predicting Bitcoin, gold, or palladium, every round sharpens your thinking and puts your
        skills to the test. And if you’re good, you’ll climb the leaderboard and unlock real rewards — sponsored by
        real businesses.
        <br>
        BitcyClub isn’t about luck. It’s about thinking fast, learning faster, and having fun while doing it.
        <br>
        That’s the point.
